# DiscordBot

### First we need to add your bot to your server and get a token
Follow this guide: [Creating a discord bot & getting a token by reactiflux](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token)

##### Then we need to setup our bot on our computer 
1. Create a folder where your bot will be located and go there in terminal/node.js command prompt
2. Download the repository's file into your project folder

##### We also need to install 'dependencies', so that our bot can connect to our server in discord and work
1. [First we need Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/)
4. Run all of these commands, using node.js command prompt as administator
If you are on windows first run `npm install --global windows-build-tools`.
If you are on debian (eg. ubuntu) `sudo apt-get install libav-tools -y`, otherwise run `npm i -g ffmpeg-binaries` for all other OSes.
Then run `npm install`

##### Run it 
1. Run `node bot`
2. Now the bot should show up in the server you told it to and you can type `!help` for a list of commands
3. Give your bot admin under roles so that it can perform all of its functions.
